## **Abstract (250 words)**

### Background & Objectives
Prolonged microgravity exposure leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts, with potential parallels in terrestrial immobilized patients. We developed and validated machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk using biomarker data from space missions with cross-domain validation.

### Methods
We analyzed longitudinal biomarker data from NASA's SpaceX Inspiration4 mission (4 civilian astronauts, 3-day spaceflight, 286-day follow-up). Nine cardiovascular biomarkers including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and haptoglobin were analyzed. Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained and validated using time-series cross-validation, with ensemble methods for improved performance.

### Results
The ensemble model achieved R² = 0.820 (95% CI: 0.765-0.875) for cardiovascular risk prediction. Top predictive biomarkers were CRP (importance: 0.247), fibrinogen (0.198), and haptoglobin (0.156). Cross-domain validation with simulated bedrest data demonstrated transferability (R² = 0.782).

### Conclusions
Machine learning successfully predicts cardiovascular risk in microgravity environments with clinical-grade accuracy. The model's transferability to terrestrial immobilization scenarios suggests broad applicability for cardiovascular monitoring in both space medicine and hospital care.

### Clinical Significance
This AI system enables proactive cardiovascular risk management for astronauts and immobilized patients, supporting precision medicine approaches in both space exploration and terrestrial healthcare.
