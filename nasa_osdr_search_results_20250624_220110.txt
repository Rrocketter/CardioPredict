In contrast to the T cells in the circulation, T cells derived from lymph nodes hardly contain any KLRG1-expressing cells. ...

URL: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-52
Description: Changes in the physical environment modulate cell responses and may lead to the impairment or even failure of tissue function as a result of mechanotransduction processes. It has been suggested that this situation occurs in some age-related diseases and some pathological conditions observed in space, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, muscle atrophy, and impaired immune responses. All of these are associated with endothelial dysfunction but the precise mechanism is still unclear. ...

Description: Martin et al. JCI Insigh (2017). Increasing NAD+ levels by supplementing with the precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) improves cardiac function in multiple mouse models of disease. While NMN influences several aspects of mitochondrial metabolism, the molecular mechanisms by which increased NAD+ enhances cardiac function are poorly understood. A putative mechanism of NAD+ therapeutic action is via activation of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). We ass...

Title: Gender differences of gene expression profiles in brain cardiovascular centers of SHRs [hypothalamus]
Organism: Rattus norvegicus

Description: Arterial pressure (AP) is lower in pre-menopausal women than in men of similar age. Pre-menopausal women exhibit a lower sympathetic outflow and a greater baroreceptor reflex, however molecular mechanisms for the gender differences of AP regulation are still not well understood. Since the hypothalmus is strongly functionnaly connected to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a pivotal region of the medulla oblongata for regulating the set-point of AP, we hypothesized that a different neuronal fu...

Description: Acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS-1) is a morbid complication of acute cardiovascular disease. Mechanistic investigations have focused on intrarenal cellular signaling induced by ischemia/reperfusion. Additional cardiorenal connector signals have been postulated, but investigation in CRS-1 has been limited by a paucity of animal models and technical limitations precluding discovery studies of glomerular filtrate. To address these limitations, we developed a translational model of CRS-1, cardiac ar...

We show that Ezh2 stabilizes cardiac gene expression and prevents cardiac pathology by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor Six1, which functions in cardiac progenitors but is st...

Title: Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor signaling establishes AP-1 transcriptional factor  gradients and permits retinal endothelial specialization
Organism: Mus musculus
URL: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/GSE141440
Description: Transcriptional mechanisms that drive angiogenesis and organotypic endothelial specialization are poorly understood. Here, we show that retinal endothelial sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), which restrain vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, spatially restrict expression of JunB, a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors. Mechanistically, VEGF induces JunB expression at the sprouting vascular front while S1PR-dependent VE-cadhe...

Title: DNA methylation profiling of vascular maturation
Organism: Mus musculus
URL: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/GSE87374
Description: Endothelial cells line the inside of all blood vessels forming a single layer of quiescent, non-proliferating cells. While the mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis, network formation and vascular remodelling are molecularly unravelled in increasing detail, the molecular mechanisms of vascular maturation are still poorly understood. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on endothelial cells isolated from infant and adult mice to establish the epigenetic landscape of vascular maturation.
