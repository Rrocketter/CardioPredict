\section{Introduction}

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating improved risk prediction and early intervention strategies \citep{who2023cardiovascular}. The unique physiological stressors of spaceflight provide an accelerated model for understanding cardiovascular adaptations and pathophysiology, offering insights applicable to Earth-based populations \citep{hughson2018cardiovascular}.

Prolonged exposure to microgravity induces rapid cardiovascular deconditioning, including decreased plasma volume, cardiac atrophy, and altered vascular function \citep{platts2014cardiovascular}. These changes mirror pathophysiological processes observed in critically ill patients, aging populations, and individuals with cardiovascular risk factors \citep{levine2002spaceflight}. The accelerated nature of these adaptations in space provides a unique opportunity to study cardiovascular risk progression and develop predictive models with enhanced temporal resolution.

Traditional cardiovascular risk assessment relies on established scoring systems such as the Framingham Risk Score and ASCVD Risk Calculator \citep{wilson1998prediction, goff2014acc}. However, these tools demonstrate limited accuracy in specific populations and fail to incorporate novel biomarkers that may provide earlier detection of cardiovascular risk \citep{cook2007use}. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches offers the potential to overcome these limitations by analyzing complex biomarker patterns and providing personalized risk assessments.

Recent advances in space medicine research have identified key biomarkers associated with cardiovascular adaptation and risk \citep{crucian2018immune, zwart2021body}. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides unprecedented access to longitudinal biomarker data from multiple spaceflight missions, enabling comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular risk factors in extreme environments.

This study presents CardioPredict, an artificial intelligence-powered system designed to assess cardiovascular risk using space medicine-derived biomarker data. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze complex biomarker interactions, providing real-time risk stratification with clinical-grade accuracy. The system's development bridges space medicine research with Earth-based clinical applications, offering immediate utility for high-risk populations while advancing precision medicine approaches in cardiovascular care.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Sources and Collection}

Cardiovascular biomarker data were obtained from NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), focusing on studies examining cardiovascular adaptations during spaceflight and ground-based analogs. The primary datasets included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item OSD-258: Long-duration spaceflight cardiovascular biomarkers
    \item OSD-484: Microgravity-induced immune and cardiovascular changes
    \item OSD-51: Ground-based bed rest cardiovascular analogs
    \item OSD-575: Space environment cardiovascular stress markers
    \item OSD-635: Integrated physiological responses to spaceflight
\end{itemize}

Data collection encompassed pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight measurements when available, providing longitudinal assessment of biomarker changes. Ground-based analog studies included bed rest protocols ranging from 30 to 90 days, simulating microgravity-induced cardiovascular deconditioning.

\subsection{Biomarker Selection and Analysis}

Eight key cardiovascular biomarkers were selected based on their demonstrated association with cardiovascular risk and availability across datasets:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{C-reactive protein (CRP):} Primary inflammatory marker associated with cardiovascular events
    \item \textbf{Platelet factor 4 (PF4):} Thrombosis and platelet activation indicator
    \item \textbf{Fibrinogen:} Coagulation pathway marker and cardiovascular risk predictor
    \item \textbf{Haptoglobin:} Acute-phase protein indicating cardiovascular stress
