### 2.3 Risk Scoring Algorithm

#### Component Risk Calculations

**Inflammation Risk Assessment:**

- 3.0-10.0 mg/L: 45 points (High risk)
- >10.0 mg/L: 60 points (Very high risk)

Fetuin A36 Scoring (Protective Factor):
- ≥350 μg/mL: 5 points (Protective)
- 250-349 μg/mL: 15 points (Moderate)
- 150-249 μg/mL: 25 points (Elevated risk)
- <150 μg/mL: 35 points (High risk)
```

**Cardiac Injury Assessment:**
```
Troponin I Scoring:
- ≤0.012 ng/mL: 5 points (Normal)
- 0.013-0.040 ng/mL: 20 points (Mild elevation)
- 0.041-0.100 ng/mL: 40 points (Moderate elevation)
- >0.100 ng/mL: 65 points (Severe elevation)

BNP Scoring:

- <2 elevated markers: 1.0× multiplier (no synergy)
```

### 2.4 Risk Categorization and Clinical Interpretation

## 10. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Mathematical Formulations

#### Complete Risk Score Calculation
```
Risk_final = min(95, max(10, 
    (∑(Score_i × Weight_i) × Environment_multiplier × Synergy_factor) + 
    random_variation
))

Where:
- Score_i: Individual biomarker risk scores
- Weight_i: Clinical importance weights
- Environment_multiplier: Mission-specific adjustment
- Synergy_factor: Multi-biomarker interaction effect
- random_variation: Biological variability (-1.5 to +1.5)
```

#### Statistical Performance Calculations
```
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
NPV = TN / (TN + FN)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
AUC = ∫[0,1] TPR(FPR⁻¹(x)) dx
```

### Appendix B: Reference Ranges and Thresholds

#### Clinical Reference Ranges
```
Biomarker Normal Ranges:
- CRP: <1.0 mg/L (low risk), 1.0-3.0 mg/L (average), >3.0 mg/L (high)
- PF4: 4-20 ng/mL (normal range)
- Fetuin A36: 200-600 μg/mL (normal range)
- Troponin I: <0.012 ng/mL (normal), >0.040 ng/mL (elevated)
- BNP: <35 pg/mL (normal), >100 pg/mL (elevated)
- Fibrinogen: 200-400 mg/dL (normal range)
- LDL: <100 mg/dL (optimal), >130 mg/dL (elevated)
- HDL: >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)
- Systolic BP: <120 mmHg (normal), >140 mmHg (hypertensive)
