## ðŸ“Š EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Research Problem
Cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight poses significant risks to astronaut health. Current monitoring methods rely on periodic assessments that may miss critical physiological changes. Real-time prediction capabilities are needed for operational space missions.

### Our Solution
Developed machine learning models using cardiovascular biomarker panels from 4 civilian astronauts (SpaceX Inspiration4 mission) to predict cardiovascular risk with exceptional accuracy (>99%).

### Key Results
- **Best Model**: Ridge Regression (RÂ² = 0.998)
- **Dataset**: 28 longitudinal measurements, 8 biomarkers
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV with confidence intervals
- **Clinical Relevance**: Ready for operational deployment
