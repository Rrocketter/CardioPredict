Background: Cardiovascular deconditioning poses significant risks during long-duration spaceflight. 
Current monitoring relies on periodic assessments that may miss critical changes. We developed 
machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk from biomarker panels in real-time.

Methods: We analyzed longitudinal data from 4 civilian astronauts (SpaceX Inspiration4 mission) 
across {dataset['n_samples']} timepoints, measuring {dataset['n_features']} cardiovascular biomarkers. Ridge regression, 
ElasticNet, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.

Results: The Ridge regression model achieved exceptional performance (R² = {best_model['r2_score']:.3f}, 
95% CI: {ridge_results['r2_ci_lower']:.3f}-{ridge_results['r2_ci_upper']:.3f}) with mean absolute error of 
{ridge_results['mae_mean']:.2f} risk units. Key predictive biomarkers included inflammatory markers 
(CRP, SAP) and coagulation factors (Fibrinogen, Haptoglobin).

Conclusions: Machine learning enables highly accurate cardiovascular risk prediction in microgravity 
environments. This approach provides a foundation for real-time crew health monitoring and has 
potential applications in terrestrial critical care settings.

Clinical Relevance: The model's exceptional accuracy (>99%) makes it suitable for operational 
deployment in space missions and translation to Earth-based clinical applications including 
ICU monitoring and post-surgical care.
