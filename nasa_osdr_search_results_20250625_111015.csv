We then assay the functional relevance of one of the array hits, the cell-cycle regulator pim1, which was upregulated on the microarray. By overexpressing pim1, we observe a loss of vascular stability, similar to that of iguana mutants. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of pim1 in iguana mutant embryos o...","Danio rerio","1","https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/GSE48335"

The initiation of this process is accompanied by auxin-responsive and MONOPTEROS (MP) transcription factor-mediated modulations in gene expression. Here, we show that MP directly activates the expression of Dof5.8, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. Consistently, mutations within Dof5.8 enhanced the phenotype of...","Arabidopsis thaliana","1","https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/GSE47808"
